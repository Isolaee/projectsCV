# MTG Sorter versio 2.

## Why?
I decided to rewrite the program simply beacuse I was not happy with it. I can do better.

## The Plan
Simple plan is to rewrite the program.
Not so simple plan is to:
- Create digital diagrams
- Enforce coding habits, and implement tests
- Rewrite the classes
- New error handling

## Tools
- Tests: pyTest/Tox
- Coding: black/flake8/Secrets
- Git: pre-commit/Git
