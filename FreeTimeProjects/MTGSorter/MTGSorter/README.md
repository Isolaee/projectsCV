# MTG Sorter

## IDEA
The idea was to make a data tool for cardgame "Magic the Gathering". I also decided to practive OOP skills.

## Planning
I made the plans by pen and paper.

## Practical coding.
I have implemented my own classes for data.
I used several 3rd party libraries. Like Pandas, Tensorflow.
GUI is made with JarApp

## What did I learn?
I got good experience with OOP and handling data. But After I could leave this project to rest, I am just not happy with it. I will rewrite the program with proper (digital) plans and implement few abstract classes as well as some test and QA tools.
